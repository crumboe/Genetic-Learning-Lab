        "\n",
        "The `PIDController` class is what actually controls the cart. It's a classic control algorithm from the 1920s that's still used everywhere today because it works and it's simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What's Inside\n",
        "\n",
        "**State variables it tracks:**\n",
        "- `integral`: Running sum of all past errors (accumulated error over time)\n",
        "- `prev_error`: What the error was last timestep (needed to calculate rate of change)\n",
        "- `integral_limit`: Cap on how big the integral can get (anti-windup protection)\n",
        "\n",
        "**The control equation:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "force = Kp × error + Ki × ∫error·dt + Kd × (derivative of error)\n",

        "- **Kp (Proportional):** Push harder when the pole is tilted more. Simple.\n",
        "- **Ki (Integral):** If there's a constant drift, this fixes it over time. Prevents steady-state error.\n",
        "- **Kd (Derivative):** If the pole is falling fast, this adds damping. Prevents overshooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem? Picking good values for Kp, Ki, and Kd. That's where the genetic algorithm comes in.\n",

        "### How It Actually Works\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **You give it an error signal:** How far the pole is from vertical (the angle)\n",
        "2. **Proportional term (Kp):** Pushes proportionally to current error\n",
        "   - Pole tilted 10°? Push harder than if it's tilted 2°\n",
        "   - Simple, reactive, but can overshoot\n",
        "3. **Integral term (Ki):** Fixes persistent bias/drift\n",
        "   - If there's a constant error that Kp isn't eliminating, Ki accumulates it and corrects\n",
        "   - **Anti-windup protection:** We clamp this at ±`INTEGRAL_LIMIT` so it doesn't grow forever\n",
        "   - Without this limit, the integral can wind up to huge values and cause instability\n",
        "4. **Derivative term (Kd):** Predicts where things are going\n",
        "   - If the pole is falling fast, apply more damping\n",
        "   - Prevents overshooting and oscillation\n",
        "   - Anticipatory control\n",

        "### The Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "- `reset()`: Call this at the start of each episode. Clears integral and previous error.\n",
        "- `compute(error, dt)`: Feed it the current error, get back a force value\n",
        "  - Uses `PID_TIMESTEP` from config (0.02 seconds by default)\n",
        "  - Returns the force command\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why PID for This?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Only 3 parameters to tune (Kp, Ki, Kd) - that's what the GA is for\n",
        "- Doesn't need a model of the physics - just reacts to what it sees\n",
        "- Fast - just some multiplication and addition\n",
        "- Proven - used in cruise control, thermostats, industrial robots, drones, basically everything\n",
        "\n",
        "The GA's job is finding good values for Kp, Ki, and Kd. Manual tuning would take forever and probably wouldn't find the optimal values anyway."

        "\n",
        "**`initialize_population()`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Creates the starting generation. Samples from the middle 30-60% of each parameter range instead of completely random values. Why? Because pure random usually gives you garbage that fails immediately. This gives evolution a reasonable starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`evaluate_population(population, current_gen)`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Tests every individual. Runs each PID controller on CartPole, averages over multiple episodes to reduce random noise, stores fitness scores. Renders the best one so you can watch. Updates visualization data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`selection(population, fitness)`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Tournament selection: randomly pick two individuals, whoever has higher fitness becomes a parent. Repeat until you have enough parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why this instead of just taking the top performers? Because tournaments maintain genetic diversity. Weak solutions still have a chance to contribute genes. Pure \"survival of the fittest\" converges too fast and gets stuck in local optima.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`crossover(parent1, parent2)`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Single-point crossover. Pick a random cut point, swap everything after it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Parent 1: [Kp1, Ki1, Kd1]\n",
        "Parent 2: [Kp2, Ki2, Kd2]\n",
        "Cut after position 1\n",
        "Child 1:  [Kp1, Ki2, Kd2]\n",

        "\n",
        "Happens with probability CROSSOVER_RATE (default 0.8). If crossover doesn't occur, children are clones of parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "This works because good traits from different individuals can be combined. Parent1's good Kp + Parent2's good Kd = potentially better offspring.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`mutate(individual)`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Adds Gaussian noise to parameters. Each one has MUTATION_RATE chance of changing. The change size is proportional to the current value (scaled by MUTATION_EFFECT), then clipped to stay in bounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Kp=25, MUTATION_EFFECT=0.15 → mutation adds roughly ±3.75\n",
        "\n",
        "Small changes are more likely than big jumps. This refines solutions instead of destroying them with random chaos.\n",
